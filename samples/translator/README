About the sample
-----------------

This is a sample application using the SAAJ API. 

The TranslationService talks to babelfish.altavista.com making an HTTP 
connection and extracts the translations of the input text string from 
the response. The text is translated to German, Italian and French languages. 

The translations can be returned either as attachments to a SAAJ message or 
within the SOAPBody depending on which option is chosen 
in the radio button from the application's index.html. If using a proxy, 
the proxy settings (both host and port) need to be entered.
